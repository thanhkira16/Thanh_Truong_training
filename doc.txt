Git keeps all of its files in the .git directory. Just remove that one and init again.

If you can't find it, it's because it is hidden.

In Windows 7, you need to go to your folder, click on Organize on the top left, then click on Folder and search options, then click on the View tab and click on the Show hidden files, folders and drives radio button.

On a Mac OS:

Open a Terminal (via Spotlight: press CMD + SPACE, type terminal and press Enter) and run:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1 && killall Finder
Note: The keyboard shortcut to show hidden files in Finder is CMD + SHIFT + . so it is no longer necessary to modify the finder config this way

You could also type cd (the space is important), drag and drop your git repo folder from Finder to the terminal window, press return, then type rm -fr .git, then return again.

On Ubuntu, use shortcut Ctrl + H.
